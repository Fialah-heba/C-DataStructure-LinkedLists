# **Linked Lists: Radix Sort**
## **Overview**
In this project, will  be implement an application of Linked Lists: **Radix 
Sort**. 

This application should be able to sort a list of strings (i.e., words and 
assume words start only with letters) from an input file using Radix Sort. 
This should be done using a doubly implementation of the Linked List. 

Assume the maximum length of the input string is 30 characters; the input 
file would contain an unspecified number of strings. The input file should 
contain one string in each line. Having read the strings successfully, this 
application should then sort the input strings using the Radix Sort 
algorithm. 

The user should be displayed a menu with the options necessary to run the 
functionalities of the program (i.e., read the input file, print the strings 
before sorting, sort the strings, print the sorted strings, and exit). 

This application should be able to show the following information through 
a proper menu of the application: 

1. Load the strings 
2. Print the strings before sorting 
3. Sort the strings 
4. Print the sorted strings 
5. Add a new word to the list of sorted strings (and sort it) 
6. Delete a word from the sorted strings 
7. Save to output file 
8. Exit
